My understanding is to find if the given user is part of a group. 

consider a hierarchy 

parent --> Child  --> subChild --> User
			|			|
		  childUser    subChildUser
		  
		  
		  
So childUser is part of Groups - Child & parent
Similarly subChildUser is part of Groups - subChild, Child & parent

So i used iterative approach to check for Users in Groups. 

The Complexity is O(n^2), where n is the no of groups and users
