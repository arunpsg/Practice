My understanding is to find if the given user is part of a group. 

consider a hierarchy 

parent --> Child  --> subChild --> User
	     |		|
	  childUser    subChildUser
		  
		  
		  
So childUser is part of Groups - Child & parent
Similarly subChildUser is part of Groups - subChild, Child & parent

So i used iterative approach to check for Users in Groups. 

The Complexity is O(n^2), where n is the no of groups and users:
  There are 2 for loops which traverses through groups and children.
  Overall complexity is O(n^2)

Space complexity:
    worst-case :O(n) where n is the total number of group and users
    it will change based on the number of input groups and users value.
