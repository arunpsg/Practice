Used os library methods to check if the file ends with particular format. 
Used os.path.isfile(path) to confirm if the given path is a directory or a file.
Used os.path.join() method for concatenating directory paths

Time Complexity is O(n) where n is the number of directories and Files in the given path:
    There is a single for loop which traverses till last element of the path using recursion which consists of directories and files.
    Overall the complexity is O(number of directories + Files)

Space COmplexity:
    Worst-case: if the path has too many directories and files. - O(n), where n is the total number of elements to be traversed.
    O(1): if the given path is a file name
    Overall: O(n)
