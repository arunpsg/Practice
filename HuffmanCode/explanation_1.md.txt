Started with building the tree first and adding binaries for each alphabet

Doing the reverse for decoding and appending the text. Handled single case string case as well.

Time Complexity for decoding : O(n) where n is the number of characters in encoded string
Tie Complexity for Encoding : sorted() function is having worst-case complexity of O(nlogn).
So time complexity is O(n * nlogn) for encoding and decoding, where n is the number of characters in input data

Space complexity for Encoding : O(n + l), where n is the number of characters in input data, l is the space occupied by encoded list
Space complexity for Decoding : O(n + l), where n is the number of characters in input data, l is the space occupied by encoded list
Auxillary space to be considered: Space utilized by decoded list and encoded list.
